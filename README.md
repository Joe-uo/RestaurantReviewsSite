# Assignment Code

This is the template code that you will need to use as a starting point for your coursework.

You should make sure you are accessing Codio using a standards-compliant web browser such as **Google Chrome** or **Chromium**.

## Updating The System


## Updating NodeJS

Before starting your assignment you should ensure that the server is updated with all necessary packages and tools installed. The process has been encapsulated in a shell script `setup.sh`.

You should run this script after ensuring it is executable by opening the terminal from the View menu and running the following commands:

```shell
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

## Running Your Server

All the core packages have already been installed so all you need to do to get your server running is to run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
$ node index.js
  listening on port 8080
```

This will start your web server. To view your website click on the dropdown list labelled **Live Site** at the top of the Codio window and choose the **New browser tab** option. This will open your website in a new tab.

To make life easier you can split your editor window both horizontally and/or vertically so you can see both the code and the terminal. Use the **View > Panels** and **View > Layout** menus.
